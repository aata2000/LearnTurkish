Hey everyone, welcome to Learn Turkish Notes #1.
Here, you will learn how basic Turkish sentences are constructed. I will first introduce the concept of sentence order, so that you -an English speaker-
have an idea of how Turkish sentences work.
Let's start by writing a basic English sentence: "Aaron wants to go to the movies."
As you can see here, we have a Subject-Verb-Object order in English.
In Turkish, this sentence would be "Arda sinemaya gidiyor."
Here, one can easily realize that "sinema" in Turkish means "cinema" in English, and infer that this sentence is a Subject-Object-Verb sentence.  
Another important thing to note is the number of words. In the Turkish equivalent of the sentence, there appears to be less words compared to the English 
version of the sentence.
The reason for that is the suffix-based writing system of Turkish, which we will get to in future notes. 
For now, just know that Turkish is a Subject-Object-Verb language, and prepositions are added as suffixes.
One tip to make thinking in Turkish for English speakers would be to translate Yoda's English to Turkish as you begin learning it.
For example, instead of saying "I am taking my basketball to the court." Say "I my basketball to the court am taking."
The sentence "I am taking my basketball to the court." would be translated as "Ben basketbol topumu basketbol sahasına götürüyorum." in Turkish,
with "götürüyorum" being the verb.
