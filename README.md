# LearnTurkish
If you want to learn Turkish, check out these notes! (I will update it every day).
All comments and feedback are welcome! Please send me a message through Github if you have any questions or recommendations.
Enjoy this free resource! I hope you end up learning my language and develop a passion for it. If you ever visit Turkey, make sure to try to speak Turkish
with the locals, they would appreciate it a lot and would help you with your sentences too!
If you would like to use parts of it, please don't forget to give me credit! Otherwise, it is free to use anywhere.
Haydi başlayalım!


I will be uploading every 10 lesson notes as a bundle after typing them into a more presentable and readable document. Currently, we have completed lesson
#4. When I type the notes, I might change the order of lessons a bit, to improve understandability.
